# Project Overview

Project Description

I would like to create a website/ platform that can be used to showcase different creative concepts the design team and I have developed these past few years and quantify the many tests we have launched. For this project I would like to take the top 5 performing creatives and detail the process of coming up with the idea, a simple “how to” and some performance data. I would like for this site to serve as a portfolio of where we can keep track of all our efforts and measure success through creative and their impact they had on our growth this year. 

Who Will Use It? This site is going to be used by our Design and Operations team. 

Why? To help us keep track of all creative efforts and learn from our win and losses. This can be helpful to identify creatives that work well for specific verticals and products.
