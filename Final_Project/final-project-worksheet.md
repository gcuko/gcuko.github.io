# Project Overview
I would like to create a platform for potential new clients to showcase our company's top three performing products and 5 different creative concepts we run on these products and how they each perform and some data on the performance on these creatives. Ultimately, I would like for this site to serve as a portfolio of where we can keep track of all our efforts and measure success through creative and their impact they had on our growth this year as well as a recourse for Sales to use while prospecting new clients.

- Responsive 
- Image Slideshow / hover over image and it expands
